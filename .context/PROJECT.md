# Ghost Project Context

## Vision

A voice-controlled, local-first AI system for the Mozilla Fellowship.
**Deadline:** Feb 13, 2026

## Constraints

- **Offline-only:** No external API dependency for core functions.
- **Zero Telemetry:** Privacy by design.
- **Consumer Hardware Support:** Must run on standard devices (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B, Whisper Tiny).

## Core Principles

1. **Sovereignty:** User data never leaves the device.
2. **Speed:** Transactional architecture for low latency.
3. **Safety:** Kernel-level permission gating.
